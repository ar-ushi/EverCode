Inspired from the online learning route due to COVID-19,I am working on a clone of the popular software,Evernote as part of my challenge to learn React.

This web-app makes use of several technologies :

1) Server side - Node Express with GraphQL as the query language for the API for the app.

2) Client side - React Hooks.
